Project Title: Railway Reservation System

Developer: Mohamed Ismail

Description:

As a Java developer, I have created a console-level project for a railway reservation system. This system allows users to perform various operations related to ticket booking, cancellation, and passenger information management.

Features:

Ticket Availability: Users can view the availability of tickets for different journeys.

Ticket Booking: The system enables users to book tickets for their desired journeys.

Senior Citizen Priority: Passengers above the age of 60 are automatically allocated lower berths. If lower berths are unavailable, the system assigns middle berths. In cases where neither lower nor middle berths are available, upper berths are allocated.

Child Ticketing: Children below the age of 5 are exempt from berth allocation.

Ticket Printing: Users can print their booked tickets for reference.

Ticket Cancellation: The system supports ticket cancellation functionality.

Database Integration: Passenger details are stored in a MySQL database. For implementation details, refer to the 'database.java' file, which provides a step-by-step explanation of how passenger details are stored in the database.

Conclusion:

This railway reservation system project offers essential functionalities for managing ticket booking and passenger information. It provides a seamless experience for users to interact with the system through the console interface while ensuring efficient data management through MySQL database integration.
